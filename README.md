A coding platform with enhanced collaboration and competition features. Create rooms to connect and solve problems together with other coders üë®üèª‚Äçüíª.

## Project Description

CodeCord is a web application that draws inspiration from the now-defunct binarysearch.com. It offers a platform for users to engage in **problem-solving** by tackling data structures and algorithm challenges. Additionally, users have the opportunity to participate in weekly contests, track their contest ratings, and maintain a streak of daily problem-solving.

In addition to the core features found on platforms like leetcode.com, CodeCord introduces a unique capability: the ability to **create live coding rooms**. These rooms enable users to invite their friends and collaborate on coding tasks together. Within a coding room, users have the flexibility to either initiate a contest, where a specific set of problems must be solved within a time limit, allowing for friendly competition among participants, or create a normal room where multiple users can code simultaneously using a shared editor.

CodeCord combines problem-solving, competition, and collaborative coding in a single platform, providing an enriched coding experience for users.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

1. Git: Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Node.js: Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Follow the steps below to install and set up CodeCord:

#### Step 1: Fork the repository

- Go to the CodeCord repository on GitHub.
- Click on the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

#### Step 2: Clone the repository

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to clone the repository to your desktop:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CodeCord.git
  ```

#### Step 3: Install dependencies and set up

- Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.
- Run the following commands to install the required dependencies and set up CodeCord:

  ```shell
  npm install
  npm run setup
  ```

#### Step 4: Create a .env file in the server directory

- Navigate to the server directory in the cloned repository.
- Create a file named `.env`.
- Use the provided example file as a reference to set up the necessary configuration in the `.env` file. Note that the server won't start without this file.

#### Step 5: Install and configure MongoDB

- Install MongoDB Compass from the official website.
- Connect to `localhost:27017` using MongoDB Compass.
- Create a database named "codecord".
- Add two collections: "problems" and "problemtags".
- Import the `problems.json` and `problemtags.json` files from the cloned repository into their respective collections.

#### Step 6: Start the development servers

- Open two terminals or command prompts.
- In one terminal, navigate to the client subdirectory.
- In the other terminal, navigate to the server subdirectory.
- Run the following command in both terminals to start the development servers:

  ```shell
  npm run dev
  ```

Make sure to follow each step carefully to properly install and run CodeCord üòÑ.

## How to use the project:

1. To navigate through the pages of the project make sure you have the .env file setup properly with database collections on MongoDB Compass.
2. The landing page provides a footer with links to three main components of the project, Contests, Problems and Discussion. You can even click the login/signup button to navigate to the main page.
3. Currently, you can only use features such as:
   - filtering problems
   - creating an Account
   - updating your user profile
   - creating and joining rooms
